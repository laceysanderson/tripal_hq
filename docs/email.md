# Configuration email notices

Tripal HQ is configured to notify both users and administrators when the following events occur for a given requested record:

* Creation
* Edit (not yet implemented)
* Approval
* Rejection

## Setting and un-setting notifications

User and administrator notifications for the above events can be configured at `admin/tripal/tripal_hq` in the **Email Notification Settings** section. If a box is checked, then email notices will be sent to that role for that event.
