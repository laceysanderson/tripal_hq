What is Tripal HQ?
====================


Tripal HQ provides a user-contributed content control center and administrative toolbox for your Tripal site.  This means that users are able to create whatever Chado content you'd like them, but withhold inserting it into the database until someone has approved it.

HQ also provides a Chado-specific permission (currently only supporting organisms).  If you have lots of organisms on your site, and want to allow users to be the admin of a specific organism or set of organisms, this feature is for you!

Module Features
================

* Users create data using your existing Bundle configuration- no extra forms!
* User dashboard area for viewing pending submissions
* Admin dashboard for viewing submissions
* Chado-based permissions to create admins for certain projects or organisms
