What is Tripal HQ?
====================


Tripal HQ provides a user-contributed content control center and administrative toolbox for your Tripal site.  This means that users are able to create whatever Chado content you'd like them, but withhold inserting it into the database until someone has approved it.

Tripal HQ Imports extends this functionality to data importers. In this way your users can submit any single-page Tripal importer and both the file and associated metadata will remain in holding for administrative review. Once approved, the importer will be run, inserting all data into the database.

HQ also provides a Chado-specific permission (currently only supporting organisms).  If you have lots of organisms on your site, and want to allow users to be the admin of a specific organism or set of organisms, this feature is for you!
