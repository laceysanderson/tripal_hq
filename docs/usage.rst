Approved, pending, and rejected content is displayed in the table.  Clicking the View/Edit button will either link to the accepted entity, or to the submission form to submit changes.


 Click the "Submit Content" button to submit Tripal Content.  The submission form is the **exact same form** as the admin content creation form.

Admins

 The HQ admin dashboard is located at ``tripal_hq/admin``.  Admins can click on the tabs to filter submissions based on their status.

 Clicking on the **title** of a pending submission will bring up the edit form, and an admin can make changes to the submission before it is created.

 If Chado-specific permissions are set, the admin will only see content on this page related to the organism they are Deputy of.
